JaRCON aims to implement a Quake 3 based admin protocol
in a CLI. It has the particularity to be able to deal
with multiple server and with colored player names.

Configuration:
	0-	Before starting anything, be sure to have added
		the java's bin folder into your $PATH.

	1-	Next to the JaRCON.jar file, you will need to create
		a file named config.properties in the .jarcon/
		subfolder. The initial content of the file can be
		empty.

	2-	Have fun using JaRCON.jar with this following command:
			'java -jar JaRCON.jar'
		You can use the --help option to see some more steps
		about adding/querying/removing server.

	3-	If you are as lazy as me, you may to an alias in your
		~/.bashrc
		Just add this lines into your .bashrc and restart bash:
			'alias rcon="java -jar JaRCON.jar"'
			
Copyright:
	I haven't put some clear copyright on it. I do not think
	this script is rather finished now, I will decide later.
